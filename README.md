# Yair Martinez

I’m a technology professional who explores where systems, automation, and security meet.  
I turn curiosity into practical projects that improve performance, reliability, and security across different environments.

My work focuses on creating small but complete solutions—tools that can be built, tested, and documented with clarity.  
This GitHub is where I share that process. My portfolio provides the stories behind each project.

## Approach

I value simplicity, consistency, and documentation.  
Each repository includes clear instructions, organized folders, and small examples for testing.  
I aim to make technical work understandable—to show not just what I built, but how it works.

Exploring technology through hands-on projects and real-world applications.
