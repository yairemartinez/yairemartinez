# Yair Martinez

Entry-level IT and systems-focused professional with hands-on experience across Windows, Linux, networking, automation, and security fundamentals. I build small, complete technical projects that emphasize reliability, clarity, and documentation.

My work focuses on practical system administration, automation, and security-aware tooling developed through structured labs and self-directed projects. Each repository is designed to be testable, well-documented, and grounded in real-world operational scenarios.

This GitHub highlights selected projects that demonstrate how I approach problem-solving across IT support, systems, and security-adjacent domains. Detailed explanations, design decisions, and lessons learned are documented in my portfolio.

## Working Approach

I prioritize simplicity, consistency, and clear documentation. Each project includes structured setup instructions, scoped objectives, and repeatable testing scenarios to make both the technical outcome and the process easy to understand.

The goal is not just to show what was built, but how it works and why design decisions were made.
